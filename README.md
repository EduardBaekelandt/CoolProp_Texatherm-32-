# CoolProp_Texatherm-32-
Hello everyone, for my final paper I have to work with CoolProp in Python. I should use texatherm 32 as the fluid. On line 39 it says I use water, but so this should be Texatherm 32. Texatherm 22 is in there but so I need texatherm 32.... I don't know how to add or create it.  Thanks in advance
